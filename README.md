# CamPDF

Free, fully offline document scanner and PDF maker (Android, Kotlin + Jetpack Compose).

- No INTERNET permission, no accounts, no ads, no analytics
- Scan with CameraX or import images; offline edge detection (blur + Sobel + contour/hull quad fitting), perspective correction with true page proportions, manual corner crop
- In-app PDF viewer; re-open any saved PDF to add / reorder / rotate / delete pages and save
- Filters with live thumbnails: Original, Lighten, Enhance, No shadow, B&W (shadow removal + adaptive threshold + sharpening)
- Draw a signature once and stamp it on any page
- Compact PDFs (High / Balanced / Compact), share sheet, save to phone, rename, search
- Sinhala / Tamil / English, light / dark theme, optional biometric app lock

## Build with GitHub Actions
1. Create a GitHub repo and push this folder to `main`.
2. Open the **Actions** tab, run **Build CamPDF APK** (it also runs on every push).
3. Download the `CamPDF-release-apk` artifact and install the APK.

Optional release signing: add repository secrets `KEYSTORE_BASE64` (base64 of your .jks),
`KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `KEY_ALIAS`, `KEY_PASSWORD`. Without them the release APK is debug-signed
(still installable).

## Local build
Install Android Studio (JDK 17) and open the folder, or run `gradle assembleDebug`.


## CamPDF scan engine update (Priority 1–3)

This source update focuses on the existing offline scanning pipeline:

- **Document detection (Priority 1):** candidate scoring now includes a document-shape plausibility score in addition to edge strength, component fill, and detected area. Portrait, landscape, receipt, and near-square documents remain eligible.
- **Image enhancement (Priority 2):** the BW filter threshold is derived from robust image percentile levels instead of relying on one fixed threshold. This is intended to adapt to dim captures and varied paper/ink density while retaining a soft transition for fine strokes. The existing local background/shadow estimation and color-preserving `NO_SHADOW` path remain offline.
- **Perspective correction (Priority 3):** perspective warp now validates normalized corner input, checks convexity and minimum quadrilateral area, limits aspect-ratio correction, initializes output as white, and uses a safe fallback for invalid transform matrices.

These are algorithmic improvements, not a claim of parity with CamScanner. Test on a range of real devices and document samples (white paper on bright/dark surfaces, receipts, folded sheets, handwritten forms, and landscape documents) before release. This environment did not have an Android SDK/Gradle build tool configured, so a compile/device test could not be run here.
